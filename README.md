## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- [React](https://reactjs.org/) - JS library

### What I learned

This project has been an incredible learning experience. First, I learned how to create a React application using Vite. Additionally, it was an excellent opportunity to practice Flexbox techniques I studied in the HTML and CSS course, as well as to gain further hands-on experience with React.

### Continued development

In the next projects, i will practice more exercises from Fronted Mentor site, to be more better programmer.
